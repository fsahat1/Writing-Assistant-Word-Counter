# Writing-Assistant-Word-Counter
Personal project to study image analysis and possibly mobile app development 

The project at hand is intended to work as an iterative software with added features. The basic element that I want to learn is image recognition and word counting. 

**GOAL: Make an open-source free software to assist creative writers in reaching their writing goals**

Many writers still use analog writing methods such as writing by hand, in notebooks and on typewriters. Using image recognition, I'd like to enable these physical fans to count the lines and words on their written pages.

**Development plan**
1) Explore code solutions for image recognition and document detection - mid December 2023
2) Implement document detection with background isolation - by January 2023
3) Implement word and line count on isolated image - before exam period (February 2023)

**Features that I would like to implement further**
- mobile version of software
- counters for individual projects with cumulative values and progress trackers
- timer option

**Eventual growth of project**
- Social media aspect with progress sharing opportunities


The application will be **free** if functional and released, and the code will stay open-source for all addendums under the GPL 3.0 License. Feel free to fix & edit. 
Code that is taken from other sources will be credited in code comments and in additional documentation
